# MatrixLibrary
A matrix library that contains multiple solvers of Matrices:
  - Gaussian Elimination
  - Jacobi Iterative Method
  - Gauss Seidel Iterative Method
  - Successive Over-Relaxation Iterative Method
  - LU Decomposition
  - Power Method
  - Newthon Method
  - Bisection Method

<p>
The program uses matData.txt as the input file. When saving a current matrix, the program uses the Output.txt file. Finally, the program uses the Sol_Output.txt file to hold the solution matrix.
